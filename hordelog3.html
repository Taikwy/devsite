        <h3>too little</h3>
        <hr>
        Everything feels like it's not enough. <br><br>
        I've written down plenty of ideas for devlogs, but it's <i>not enough</i>. <br>
        I've continued working on the game's visuals, but it's <i>not enough</i>. <br>
        I've even started to iron out more of the gameplay mechanics, but it's <i>not enough</i>. <br>
        <br>
        My goal is to eventually release this game and hopefully even make a bit of money off of it - but will it be enough?
        <br><br><br>

        <h3>too much</h3>
        <hr>
        Working on this project alone feels excruciating at times. <br><br>
        There's <i>so</i> much code to write. <br>
        There's <i>so</i> much art to create. <br>
        There's <i>so</i> much gameplay to design.
        <br><br><br>

        <h3>restless</h3>
        <hr>
        I can't just work on my game in peace. <br><br>
        I <i>need</i> sales so I can keep making games. <br>
        I <i>need</i> wishlists so I can eventually make sales. <br>
        I <i>need</i> to advertise the game so people actually wishlist. <br>
        I <i>need</i> the game to look nice so the game looks appealing at a glance. <br>
        <br>
        So many hoops to jump through. <br>
        Nothing comes easy.
        <br><br><br>

        <br><hr><br>
        I've been stuck in ui jail, so I don't really have much time to write a fancier devlog at the moment. My bad.
        <br><br>
        Hopefully the next devlog I post will cover more interesting things.

        <br><br><br><br>
