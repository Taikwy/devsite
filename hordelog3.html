        <h3>too little</h3>
        <hr>
        Everything feels like it's not enough. <br><br>
        I've written down plenty of ideas for devlogs, but it's <i>not enough</i>. <br>
        I've continued working on the game's visuals, but it's <i>not enough</i>. <br>
        I've even started to iron out more of the gameplay mechanics, but it's <i>not enough</i>. <br>
        <br>
        My goal is to eventually release this game and hopefully even make a bit of money off of it - but will it be enough?
        <br><br><br>

        <h3>too much</h3>
        <hr>
        Working on this project alone feels excruciating at times. <br><br>
        There's <i>so</i> much code to write. <br>
        There's <i>so</i> much art to create. <br>
        There's <i>so</i> much gameplay to design. <br>
        <br>
        And there's so little of me.
        <br><br><br>

        <h3>restless</h3>

        I can't just work on my game at my own pace. <br><br>
        My goal is to eventually make sales, so I need wishlists, so I need to advertise the game. <br>
        Even if it's just posting on social media, the things I work on need to adhere to what might make the game look appealing. <br><br>
        I <i>want</i> to just lock in and grind, but posting consistently is the best way for social media growth. <br>
        I <i>want</i> to just work on the gameplay, but things like ui and graphical variety look fancier for progress. <br>
        I <i>want</i> to just ignore everything else and do things at my own pace. <br><br>
        But I can't afford to be selfish.
        <br><br><br>

        <!-- <h3>restless</h3>
        <hr>
        I can't just work on my game in peace. <br><br>
        I <i>need</i> sales so I can keep making games. <br>
        I <i>need</i> wishlists so I can eventually make sales. <br>
        I <i>need</i> to advertise the game so people actually wishlist. <br>
        I <i>need</i> the game to look nice so the game looks appealing at a glance. <br>
        <br>
        So many hoops to jump through. <br>
        Nothing comes easy.

        <br><hr><br>
        This has been a very short and plain devlog. Sorry if it wasn't really that interesting to read.
        <br><br>
        Hopefully the next devlog will cover some more substantial insight about my game's progress.

        <br><br><br><br>
        <i>thanks for reading :)</i>
