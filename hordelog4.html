        <h2>04 - UI Hurdle</h2>

        <h3>biting the bullet</h3>
        <hr>
        UI has been an ever present thorn in my side ever since I created the first prototype build. It's not something that would top my to-do list - things like gameplay and progression mechanics are much higher priority. But since I plan on uploading demo builds for people to try, having some UI to actually display information is obviously important. As a result, I've had to spend loads of time designing and implementing UI even though it's something I think I <i>should</i> be adding a little later down the line.
        <br><br>
        <i>You can try the new build of my game with all the new UI <a href="https://taikwy.itch.io/horde-prototype" target="_blank">here</a>!</i>
        <br><br><br>

        
        <h3>general design</h3>
        <hr>
        strong sharp shapes and corners, adding a slant makes a massive difference, a pop art style to sell the vibrancy (also it's simple this way because i cant create super fancy ui like blasphemous and or hand drawn stuff like hades)
        <br><br><br>

        <h3>player HUD</h3>
        <hr>
        simple information, but plenty of user feedback. hypixel the goat
        <br><br><br>
        
        <h3>menus</h3>
        <hr>
        simple stuff, mostly piggybacking off of the general design points i made. these will change a lot in the future so they're still kinda placeholders using the art style
        <br><br><br>

        <br><hr><br>
        Don't really know what to write here, I'm just happy that I have some of the UI in place finally
        <br><br>
        I will try my best to create these devlogs more consistently.
