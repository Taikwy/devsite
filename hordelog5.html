        <h3>next year</h3>
        <hr>
        So it's the end of the year huh. I didn't really get to post many of these devlogs, maybe next year I'll write more of these.
        <br><br>
        In the meantime, I've still been spending most of my time working on the game. Hopefully I can be more efficient and make more progress next year.
        <br><br>
        I finally got a bit of UI added, but I'm still not entirely satisfied with how it looks. Next year I'll probably redo all of it again.
        <br><br>
        Gameplay is slowly coming together, most of the system mechanics are pretty solid. I hope it stays intact as I add more content and stress test the logic of everything next year.
        <br><br><br>

        <h3>do more</h3>
        <hr>
        There's still so much to work on, I have to work even harder to actually finish it all. My slow iterative process of updating the sprites is way too inefficient, I'm planning on focusing on making new sprites for new content for a good long while before going back and touching up some of the older stuff. Lots of effects and other things are also kind of unpolished, but I'll figure that out later. Gameplay-wise, it's way past time to actually start working on the roguelite elements. I have a long list of ideas and stuff written down for upgrades and items and whatever but none of it is in the game yet. I'll have to change that. The UI still feels too much like a placeholder so I'll go back through all of that again too. I find UI to be a really crucial part of a game's visual identity, and as I figure out my game's overall style more and more I'm going to want the UI to match that as well.
        <br><br>
        I've also been playing more games, both related and unrelated to my current project's genre. Even games that don't have all that much overlap with my project have still given me ideas about stuff I can add or change. Unfortunately they also give me a lot of inspiration for other projects I could work on, which I try my best to stifle.
        <br><br><br>

        <br><hr><br>
        I hope I can do more next year. But now is always the best time to start.
        <br><br>
        Time to get back to work.
