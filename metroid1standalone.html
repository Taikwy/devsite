        <h3>been a while</h3>
        <hr>
        So, my first devlog was over two months ago. Everytime I tried to set aside a bit of time to write, I found myself working more on my project instead. I suppose that's not the worst reason why I haven't made more of these, but still. I think it's good to write my thoughts out and having something to look back on. Who knows, some people might even find these bits of insight interesting. Either way, I'm gonna try my best to make devlogs more frequently in the future.
        <br><br>
        <i>By the way, I recently released a new build of my prototype! You can try it out <a href="https://taikwy.itch.io/horde-prototype" target="_blank">here</a>!</i>

        <h3>the maple tree incident</h3>
        <hr>
        I spent a lot of time brainstorming after the previous devlog. The goal was to figure out an artstyle that looks distinct and is pretty heavily stylized. I was unable to settle on anything concrete so I decided to just start making stuff to see what sticks.
        <br><br>
        I wanted to create a new autumn themed background, so that meant drawing maple tree. Unfortunately, things did not go very smoothly. After hours and hours of work, tons of trial and error, and a whole bunch of blood, sweat, and tears, I finally produced one decent maple tree sprite.
        <br><br>

        <br>
        The tree looks okay, but the entire process reminded me again just how slow I am at drawing pixel art. I don't have the time to spend 20 hours on every single asset <i>(yes, the tree really did take me 20 hours of work to sprite)</i>. It would take some time to break those habits but sticking to my perfectionist ways would only cause me to waste more time down the line. It's always easier to revise than to strike perfection the first time through.
        <br><br>
        Thankfully making the rest of the trees didn't take nearly as long. I already had an idea for the art style and color palette so I quickly* made a couple tree variants with different shapes.
        <br><br>
        <i>*still took a while but nowhere near 20 hours</i>

        <h3>back to grass</h3>
        <hr>
        At this point I was ready to make an actual level out of all the assets I'd been working on. This was also when I decided to go back to using a green background. The game would still have autumn rooms, but I had realized something while working so heavily on all the maple themed assets. At the end of the day a green grassy area - as standard as it may be - is just really appealing. They're a naturally pleasing aesthetic and I thought it'd be better if that was what I themed the first room after.
        <br><br>
        Thankfully I could reuse pretty much all of the stuff I'd made. I recolored the trees, grass, and programmed some stuff to randomize their colors. I also made a cool black barrier for the edge of the room using particle effects.

        With a proper room finished, I made some enemy waves to populate the level. I also went over some of the bullet sprites, improved the dust of the player's walk, and smoothed out the screenshake effects. Admittedly the gameplay itself is still mostly the same as the previous build, but everything looks a whole lot better.

        <br><hr><br>
        And that's everything caught up! This doesn't cover <i>everything</i> I worked on in the past two months - I had to gloss over and skip some things so this devlog wouldn't become any longer than it already is. I've got lots of cool stuff planned for the next few weeks. I'm gonna start designing the UI and actually adding some roguelite elements to the game too. I'll also be looking into getting a Steam page for the game up. Hopefully the next devlog I make won't take two months...
        <br><br>
        At the very least, the next build I post should have some pretty sick stuff.
